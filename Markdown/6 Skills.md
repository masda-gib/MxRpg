####Linguistics

You learn a language as secondary for every Tier if you have Training in linguistics and an additional language if you also have Field Training in the Interaction field.
You can choose a language twice to speak it as a primary language.

You take a -4 penalty on Diplomacy, Bluff, Intimidate and Evaluate rolls in secondary languages. (The penalty is -10 when no common language is known)

*Info: Apart from your mother tongue you have to select every language twice to speak it without penalty. This also applies to languages you select for having high INT.*
