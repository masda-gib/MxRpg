##Damage Resistance and Immunity##

A creature or object can have resistance, strong resistance or immunity to a for of damage. Resistance halfes damage, strong resistance quarters it and immunity negates it completely.

Resistance and immunity can apply to a type of energy or physical damage (fire resistance, immunity to slashing damage) or a form of damage delivery (strong resistance to direct-HP damage). Resistance is always applied after armor DR if that applies.

Resistance stacks in a special way: If an object has resistance for the same damage type from two sources it gains strong resistance. More than two resistances don't stack any further. In the same way, two strong resistances stack to immunity.

The halving of damage from resistance stacks with other effects such as half damage from a successful saving throw.

##Spell Resistance##

Spell resistance provides protection from spells. A creature can either have weak or strong spell resistance.

Weak spell resistance grants resistance to any direct damage from spells and +5 to all defense thresholds against non-damaging spell effects that affect you directly.

Strong spell resistance grants strong resistance to any direct damage from spells and +5 to all ability defenses and defense thresholds against non-damaging spell effects that affect you directly.

So spell resistance protects against a Fireball or Charm Monster but not against hits from a summoned creature or being tricked by an illusionary wall.

##Spell Immunity##

Spell immunity grants immunity to spell damage and you are treated as succeeding all saving throws against spell effects.
