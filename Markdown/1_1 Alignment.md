###Alignment

The universe is driven by 3 mayor forces:

- The entropic **Chaos** from which everything was created and to which everything will degenerate if left alone.
- The radiant forces of **Creation** which build and create and give life and light.
- The consuming forces of **Undoing** which destroy and consume and let things wither.

The forces of Creation and Undoing try to bring order to the universe. They create a steady stream of creation and destruction, birth and death, beginning and end. They are the flow of things. In the Chaos no such things exist. In Chaos there is no order, no causality - everything is the same and also nothing.
