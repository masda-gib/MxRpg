##Traits

###Background vs. Experience
The difference between background and experience traits is when you can aquire them. 
Background traits can only be taken before the first level. They are part of you childhood and your history.
Experience traits are traits you get by moving through adventures. They are the traits that make out your veteran character. They are aquired at the end of each tier. Some experience traits can also be chosen before first level with the GMs approval. You have to meet all prerequisites.

###Trait Categories

**- Basic:** A collection of sucategories that every character can take.
- **Combat:** Martial and physical background
- **Social:** Social class or upbringing
- **Magic:** Magical events or training
- **Faith:** Religious and philosophical leanings
- **Mystery:** Unusual events, secrets and traumas

**- Campaign:** Traits provided by the campaign or adventure.

**- Race:** Traits depending on race or ethnicities.

**- Regional:** Traits defining the culture of certain lands or settlements.

**- Faction:** Traits requiring the loyalty with or devotion to a faction or cause. These might be religions, guilds, lords,...

###Limits on Trait Aquisition

When gaining Background traits, you can only select one traits from each category or in the case of basic traits subcategories.

Experience traits can be chosen without limitation to category. But the traits you aquire have to reflect your experiences during the last few character levels. So the GM has the final word on wether you can gain a trait or not.
