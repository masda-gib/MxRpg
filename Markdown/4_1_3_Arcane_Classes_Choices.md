**- School Ability: Resistance** You gain resistance to an elemental energy of your choice, chosen when you prepare spells. At Caster Level 11 this changes to strong resistance. At Caster Level 20 this changes to immunity.

**- Lesser Power: Protective Ward** As a standard action, you can create a 10-foot-radius field of protective magic centered on you that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your half your INT (min 1).
All allies in this area (including you) receive a +1 deflection bonus to their DEFL. This bonus increases by +1 for every five caster Levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your INT.

**- Greater Power: Energy Absorbtion** You gain an amount of elemental or other energy absorption equal to 3 times your Caster Level per day. Whenever you take energy damage, apply immunity, vulnerability (if any), and resistance first and apply the rest to this absorption, reducing your daily total by that amount. Any damage in excess of your absorption is applied to you normally.
