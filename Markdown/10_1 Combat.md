###Combat

####Making Attacks

You attack by rolling a d20 and add your [Martial Bonus] and either your [STR] or [DEX] depending on the type of attack and weapon.

You hit if your result is equal or higher than the [DEFL] of your target.

The targets [DEFL] is 10 + half his [Martial Bonus] + his [DEX] + any deflection from armor, shield or dodge bonusses.

####Attack Types
#####Meelee Attacks
Normally you make meelee attacks using your STR.

    Attack Bonus = Martial Bonus + STR
    Damage = Weapon die + STR
    (1.5x STR for two-handed attacks)

You can use your DEX to make attacks with light or finessable weapons.

    Attack Bonus = Martial Bonus + DEX
    Damage = Weapon die + half DEX

For off hand attacks damage is modified depending on how you add your ability to damage normally:

    Full ability -> Half ability
    Half ability -> Nothing

#####Ranged Attacks
Normally you make ranged attacks with weapons such as bows and crossbows using your DEX.

    Attack Bonus = Martial Bonus + DEX
    Damage = Weapon die + half DEX

You make thrown attacks with weapons like javelins using a combination of DEX and STR. If you lack Strength, you can use the normal ranged attack formula.

    Attack Bonus = Martial Bonus + DEX
    Damage = Weapon die + (STR or half DEX)

####Attack Modifiers

#####Fencing

If you have a weapon in your main hand and nothing in your other hand, you are fencing when making meelee attacks.

When fencing, you get +1 to attack rolls and +1 precision damage with your main weapon.

When using these bonusses, you can not use your empty off-hand for anything else this round. This includes spellcasting, maneuvers, climbing or using items.

#####Covor

#####Flanking

####Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special attacks that try to affect the target in means other than doing damage. There are 4 groups of maneuvers.

    Maneuver DC       = 10 + (1/2 * Martial Bonus) + STR + DEX

#####Maneuver Groups

######Brutal Group

- Bull Rush
- Sunder
- Overrun

######Cunning Group

- Trip
- Disarm
- Stunt

######Dirty Group

- Feint
- Dirty Trick
- Demoralize

######Grapping Group

- Drag
- Grapple
- Steal

#####Bull Rush

Attacker makes an attack without weapon as an Attack Action.

If the attacker misses the initial attack, the defender can make an opportunity attack against the attacker. If the attack hits, the defender must make a STR save against the attackers Maneuver DC.

If the the defender fails partially, she is pushed back 5ft. If the defender fails fully and the attacker moves into her space she is pushed back 10ft.

#####Sunder

The attacker uses this manauver instead of a normal weapon attack.

She makes an attack against the defenders weapon, shield, held or worn item or armor. For this attack, the DEFL is modified depending on the target item:

- Clothing or armor: +0
- heavy weapon, large shield or big item (backpack): +1
- balanced weapon, small shield or medium item (satchel): +2
- light weapon, small item (flask): +3

If the attacker misses the attack, the defender can make an opportunity attack against the attacker. If the attack hits, the item is damaged normally. Armor DR does apply when attacking an armor. Other items have Armor DR depending on their material.

See a table for HP and DR of different items.

#####Overrun

The attacker uses this maneuver if she tries to move through an opponents square.
The defender can choose to let her pass. If not, the defender makes an STR save against the attackers Maneuver DC.

If the defender makes the save, the attacker stops in her last square before trying to enter the defenders square and the defender gets an opportunity attack against the attacker.

If the defender fails partially, the attacker can move through the square. If the defender fails fully she also gets knocked prone.

For every successful overrun, the Maneuver DC gets a cumulative -5 penalty until next round.

#####Trip

The attacker uses this manauver instead of a normal weapon attack.

She makes a weapon attack against the defender. If the she misses the initial attack, the defender can make an opportunity attack against the attacker. If the attack hits, the defender must make a DEX save against the attackers Maneuver DC.

If the the defender fails partially, she is knocked prone. If the defender fails fully she is knocked prone and takes 1d6 falling damage.

#####Disarm

The attacker uses this manauver instead of a normal weapon attack.

She makes an weapon attack against the defenders weapon, shield or held item. For this attack, the DEFL is modified depending on the target item:

- heavy weapon, large shield or big item (backpack): +1
- balanced weapon, small shield or medium item (satchel): +2
- light weapon, small item (flask): +3

If the attacker misses the attack, the defender can make an opportunity attack against the attacker. If the attack hits, the defender must make a DEX save against the attackers Maneuver DC. The defender gets a +2 bonus if she holds the item with two hands.

If the the defender fails partially, the targetted item falls to the ground in her square. If the defender fails fully the item falls into an adjacent square of the attackers choice. If she chooses her square (and is adjacent) and has a hand free, she catches the item.

#####Stunt

The attacker makes this maneuver as part of a move. This move must include a climb, swim, jump, slide, swing or wall-flip or something like that and the attacker must and the move threatening the target.

She makes a acrobatics or athletics check depending on the movement she did (DMs choice). If the movement itself requires such an skill check, use this result. In this case the stunt naturally fails if the skill check wasn't high enough to make the move in the first place.

The defender makes a INT save taking the skill check result as DC.

If the defender makes the save, she can make an opportunity attack against the attacker.

If the defender fails partially the attacker counts as charging. If she already counts as charging because of the movement she gains +1 to the first attack. If the defender fails fully she has surprised DEFL against the first attack of the attacker in addition to the partial effects.

#####Feint

As an Attack Action you make a Bluff Check. The defender must make a INT save taking the Bluff check result as DC.

If the defender fails partially she has surprised DEFL against the next attack of the attacker. If the defender fails fully, she has surprised DEFL against all attacks of the attacker until the start of the attackers next round.

#####Dirty Trick

Attacker makes an attack without weapon as a Standard Action.

If the attacker misses the initial attack, the defender can make an opportunity attack against the attacker. If the attack hits, the defender must make a CON save against the attackers Maneuver DC.

If the the defender fails partially, she is inflicted with a condition for 1 round. If the defender fails fully the condition lasts for 1 + 1d4 rounds.

The condition is chosen by the attacker from the following list:

- blinded
- deafened
- sickened
- ...

#####Demoralize

As a Standard Action you make an Intimidate Check. The defender must make a CHA save taking the Bluff check result as DC.

If the defender fails partially she she is shaken for one round. If the defender fails fully, she is shaken for a number of rounds equal to your skill bonus for Intimidate (at least 1).

#####Drag

Attacker makes an attack without weapon as an Attack Action.

If the attacker misses the initial attack, the defender can make an opportunity attack against the attacker. If the attack hits, the defender must make a STR save against the attackers Maneuver DC.

If the the defender fails partially, she is pulled toward or around the attacker by 5ft. If the defender would be pulled into the attackers square, the attacker must move back to avoid that. If the defender fails fully she is pulled towards or around the attacker by back 10ft.

#####Grapple

Attacker makes an attack without weapon as a Standard Action.

If the attacker misses the initial attack, the defender can make an opportunity attack against the attacker. If the attack hits, the defender must make either a STR save against the attackers Maneuver DC.

If the the defender fails partially, she and the attacker are grappling and gain the grappled condition. The attacker is controlling the grapple (this is her fixed choice for the first grapple action). If the defender fails fully the attacker doesn't gain the grappled condition.

When you are grappling, you cannot perform actions that require both hands or move.  
The grappler in control of the grapple gets a +5 bonus to the maneuver DC and can choose to end the grapple as a free action.

At the start of every subsequent turn of each grapple participant, the participant must make a STR save against the opponents Grapple Maneuver DC described above.

When the either opponent fails these further saves at least partially, the grappler can do one of the following as part of the Grapple Action:
- escape grapple (if not controlling)
- take control (if not controlling)
- do damage of unarmed strike, natural or light or balanced weapon to your opponent
- make an attack with one of the allowed weapons above against any target in reach.
- make a maneuver replacing an attack or requiring a move action without an attack roll with -2 penalty to DC
- move half speed with your opponent
- pin the opponent (when in control)
- tie up (if opponent pinned)

You can use your Move Action to make secondary attacks if you attacked during the Grapple action. But you can't move.

######Variant: Grapple Climbing

If the defender is at least a size category bigger than the attacker, the attacker can choose to climb the defender. When doing this, the defender must make a DEX save insted of a STR save after a successful initial attack.

If the the defender fails partially, only the attacker is grappling and gains the grappled condition. The defender counts as wearing armor one category heavier than actually wearing when the attacker is only one size smaller. If the defender fails fully the attacker doesn't gain the grappled condition.

The attacker moves into the targets square. The defender can move freely but the attacker follows the defender around. The attacker doen't count as in control and can not move the defender around.

To take control or move the defender around she must force the defender to make a STR save in a further Grapple check. When in control of a grapple against a bigger opponent, a grappler can also choose to force a DEX save and start climbing the opponent, giving up the control.

Since the defender is not grappling she can move and attack freely. If she has the grappled condition, she has lower DEX and half speed.  
To remove the grappling climber the defender has two options. The defender can succeed at a Grapple attempt (requires an attack roll since defender is not grappling) to grapple the opponent and later end the grapple. Or the defender can spend a Standard Action to try to shake off the climber. In this case the climber has to make a Climbing check against the defenders Grapple Maneuver DC or fall off.

#####Steal

The attacker uses this manauver instead of a normal weapon attack. This maneuver requires a free hand.

She makes an attack without weapon against an item held, worn or carried by the defender. This attack roll is modified as for the Disarm maneuver.

If the attacker misses the attack, the defender can make an opportunity attack against the attacker. If the attack hits, the defender must make a DEX save against the attackers Maneuver DC.  
The defender gets a +2 bonus if she holds the item with two hands or the item is somehow fastened or secured.  
The attacker gets a +4 bonus to the DC when she beats a Perception check by the defender with a Thievery check (at least equal).

If the the defender fails partially, the attacker holds the targetted item in her free hand and is in possession of it. If the defender fails fully she doesn't notice the theft (Rework? What are consequenses?).
