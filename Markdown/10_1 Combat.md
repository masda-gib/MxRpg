##Making Attacks##

You attack by rolling a d20 and add your [Martial Bonus] and either your [STR] or [DEX] depending on the type of attack and weapon.

You hit if your result is equal or higher than the [DEFL] of your target.

The targets [DEFL] is 10 + half his [Martial Bonus] + his [DEX] + any deflection from armor, shield or dodge bonusses.

##Attack Types##
###Meelee Attacks###
Normally you make meelee attacks using your STR.

    Attack Bonus = Martial Bonus + STR
    Damage = Weapon die + STR
    (1.5x STR for two-handed attacks)

You can use your DEX to make attacks with light or finessable weapons.

    Attack Bonus = Martial Bonus + DEX
    Damage = Weapon die + half DEX

For off hand attacks damage is modified depending on how you add your ability to damage normally:

    Full ability -> Half ability
    Half ability -> Nothing

###Ranged Attacks###
Normally you make ranged attacks with weapons such as bows and crossbows using your DEX.

    Attack Bonus = Martial Bonus + DEX
    Damage = Weapon die + half DEX

You make thrown attacks with weapons like javelins using a combination of DEX and STR. If you lack Strength, you can use the normal ranged attack formula.

    Attack Bonus = Martial Bonus + DEX
    Damage = Weapon die + (STR or half DEX)
