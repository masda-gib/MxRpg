##Effecting a target##

To effect a target with a spell you cast, you normally must overcome its defenses. This is its DEFL and/or its ability defenses.

Ability defenses exist for STR, DEX, CHA and INT.

An ability defense is 10 + Ability (+ Tier when it is a good defense).
Each defense also has a Threshold that is your CON.
