- Consuming (Negative)
- Entropic (Chaos)

#####Other Damage

- Poison (affecting living body directly)

####Special Forms of Damage

#####Nonlethal Damage

Nonlethal damage works normally on STM but doesn't do HP damage directly. 

Instead, any excess STM-Damage below 0 STM is treated like HP damage for forcing wound saving throws. Any real HP damage and excess STM damage is added when calculating when to make a saving throw and its DC.

You don't die when your excess STM damage is greater than your maximum HP. All additional exhaustion levels gained only from excess STM damage disappear when you heal all excess STM damge.

#####Precision Damage

Precision damage is a damage descriptor saying this damage needs a careful hit against an anatomy to work. Creatures immune to precission damage are not affected by this damage.

This is the case for critical hits and sneak attack for example.

#####Direct-HP Damage

Direct-HP damage ignores STM and damages HP directly. If physical normal and direct-HP damage is delivered with the same attack, armor DR only deducts damage once and first from normal damage.

Critical hits and sneak attacks with weapons are examples of physical direct-HP damage. Critical attack spell hits and poison are examples of energy direct-HP damage.
