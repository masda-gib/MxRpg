#Character Building#

##Character Creation##

###Description and Background###

When creating a character, you have to choose the following things:

- Ability Scores
- Race
- Name
- Other description like Age, Height, Weight, Looks
- 2 Background Traits
- where to distribute INT Skill Points

####Buying ability scores####

The standard method to aquire ability scores is buying them. With this system, your character starts with 2 in every of her five ability scores and has 10 points. These can be spent to increase your ability scores:

- 2 to 3: 1 point
- 3 to 4: 2 point
- 4 to 5: 3 points
- 5 to 6: 4 points

No starting ability score may be over 6 before applying race modifiers.

Selling your basic two ability score points can gain you one point for each ability score point sold.

####Starting Skills from INT####

You can distribute your Skill Points from INT to any field or skill you choose.

#### Core Skills####
If For every 3 INT you have you can designate on specific skill you have put a skill point on as a Core Skill.

A Core Skills synergy bonus is 2 instead of 1 and applies even if you have no training in that field.

###Token Effects###

As you gain levels, you gain Tokens. Three at first level and one each level thereafter.

	</tr>
</table>
\* Threshold of any one ability defense (chosen per bonus)

Each Token you have of a specific type increases the Token Level of that type by one. Depending of the Token Level you have a Token Bonus of that type.

If for example you have 8 Martial Tokens your Martial Level is 8 and your Martial Bonus is 4.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Token Level</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>2-3</td>
		<td>4-6</td>

	</tr>
</table>

####Skills from first Tokens####

The skill points gained from first level token effects can only be spent on or in fields associated with that token type. Additionally if you spend those points on specific skills (recommended) this skill counts as a Core Skill.

<table>

		<td>Arcane</td>
		<td>Divine</td>
		<td>Psychic</td>
	</tr>

	</tr>
</table>

Skill Points gained from Cunning Bonus can be distributed freely even at first level and don't let skills count as Core Skills.

###Below First Level###

Children, young characters and weak creatures might have a level of below 1. Your effective Tier is 0 in this case for everything except prerequisite for Talents and Cores.

You are only required to have at least one Core at first level when you gain your third first level Token.

- If you have 2 of your 3 first level Tokens, you count as Level 1/2.
- If you have 1 of your 3 first level Tokens, you count as Level 1/3.
- If you have 0 of your 3 first level Tokens, you count as Level 1/4. You now only have your ability scores, background traits and skills from INT as characterization.

####Level and Tier####


####Tokens####

####Traits####

####Ability Score Increase####

At some levels you can increase your ability scores. At each some point, you can either increase two abilities by 1 that were both not yet increased or you can increase any one ability by 1.

This means after the second increase of two abilities, you can only increase one ability at each point because there are only five abilities.

###Retraining###

When you gain a new Token, you are always allowed to change or remove you last Talent before choosing a new Core or Talent. Removing the last talent can be done to gain a Token to buy a new Core.

You can also change a Talent when you later gain this Talent as a bonus talent. You must then choose a new Talent you could have chosen when you got the earlier Talent to replace it.

Cores and other Talents you gained earlier can not be retrained so easiliy.
