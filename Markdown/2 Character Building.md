##Character Creation##

###Description and Background###

When creating a character, you have to choose the following things:

- Ability Scores
- Race
- Name
- Other description like Age, Height, Weight, Looks
- 2 Background Traits
- where to distribute INT Skill Points

####Buying ability scores####

The standard method to aquire ability scores is buying them. With this system, your character starts with 2 in every of her five ability scores and has 10 points. These can be spent to increase your ability scores:

- 2 to 3: 1 point
- 3 to 4: 2 point
- 4 to 5: 3 points
- 5 to 6: 4 points

No starting ability score may be over 6 before applying race modifiers.

Selling your basic two ability score points can gain you one point for each ability score point sold.

####Starting Skills from INT####

You can distribute your Skill Points from INT to any field or skill you choose.

#### Core Skills####
If For every 3 INT you have you can designate on specific skill you have put a skill point on as a Core Skill.

A Core Skills synergy bonus is 2 instead of 1 and applies even if you have no training in that field.

###Token Effects###

As you gain levels, you gain Tokens. Three at first level and one each level thereafter.
